synapse-proteomics-challenge
For this repo I am working on a dream challenge for synapse, the code is written in python and is mostly about python. For the documentation the guideline is taken from 
http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation.html
and 
http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing/documentation/#restructuredtext-ref 
and
